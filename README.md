# biometrics-face-recognition

In this project, a Biometric system was developed using a standard face recognition pipeline.
The project has the following structure:

1. Data
The dataset used was the publicly available CALTECH Faces dataset.

2. Feature extraction
The dimensionality reduction methods used were Principal Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Deep Neural Networks, and Local Binary Patterns.

3. Evaluation
A combination of standard classification metrics and biometrics-specific metrics was used to evaluate the Biometrics System. Biometrics systems performance
was evaluated in two modes of work, Identification, and Verification.
